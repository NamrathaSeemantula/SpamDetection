**Performance Analysis of Spam Detection on Five Classification Algorithms**

The spam.csv dataset is a popular dataset in the field of 
machine learning and data science that is used for research on 
email spam filtering and this datset is used to analyze the perfomance.

The provided code aims to analyze the performance 
variances of 5 Classification algorithms across **Machine 
Learning, Deep Learning and Ensemble Learning Paradigms**, 
namely, k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Na√Øve
Bayes, Recurrent Neural Networks and Random Forest Classifier 
on the Spam Detection dataset. Analysis of the dataset involves 
data cleaning, feature extraction, model training and evaluation. 
The goal is to develop a model that can accurately classify new 
emails as either spam or ham, which can be used to filter 
unwanted emails and improve the user experience.
